# MATLAB - DCS World Interface

##### Tested on Windows 10, DCS World 2.5.0.12818, MATLAB 2017b.

Currently, a simple interface to communicate between DCS World and MATLAB. This method outputs data from DCS World via Export.lua, and catches it in MATLAB over TCP. 

  1. Copy Export.lua to C:\Users\\[USER]\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\Scripts
  2. Run STREAM.m in MATLAB and wait for "Waiting for DCS client connection."
  3. Start the DCS mission (take command of the aircraft within 15 seconds of the "Connected" message from MATLAB). 

Notes:
- DCS World will begin running Export.lua only when the flight begins. Changes can be made to Export.lua between flights.
- After the connection between DCS and MATLAB is established, DCS must begin streaming data within 15 seconds or the connection will be closed.
